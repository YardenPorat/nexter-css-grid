## Building this project for production
  - **Install Dependencies** - You need to run `npm install` to use the required librarys
  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```
  - **Run the build:css script** -  In the `package.json` you'll se some scripts that compile the code, adding and compressing the sass files to better performance and optimization.
    ```sh
    $ npm run build:css:
    ```
  - **Get the compiled result** - When the build is complete, it will generate a `style.css` in de `css/` folder, that you could use in your applications.
## Important Note
This landing page was originally build by Jonas Schmedtmann, great  Udemy instructor who made this site for his online course. 
Despite changes I have made in the code, the creation is credited to Jonas Schmedtmann.
